Pull request workflow:
  - PR with comments left in
  - Add screenshot if working on a view
  - Have tests passing before making PR
  - Tag/assign the whole team on each PR
  - PR upon completion of each feature 


Code review workflow:
  - Check your emails for PRs from the team frequently
  - If comments have been made, review them and determine if they can be removed
  - Read over code to check for syntax & code style
  - Copy code onto local to check for errors
  - Add github comments where necessary for fixes, suggestions, or questions
  - Merge ONLY if everything is working/passing 
  - Delete branch after merging 


Code style:
  - use semicolons ; for end of JS lines
  - INDENTATION!!!! tab size 2
  - when method chaining, each enumerable method should begin on a new line (in JS and Rails)
  - unless absolutely necessary, don't use hashrockets =>
  - unless necessary (interpolation), use single quotes '' over double quotes ""
  - when using AJAX, do it the Rails way vs the Sinatra way
